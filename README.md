# Kryx?
Kryx is a small interpreted programming language that I'm building from scratch. The language is implemented in TypeScript but it has it's own **Syntax**, **Parser**, and **Execution Model**.

## Goals
- Learn how programming languages work internally
- Build a lexer, parser, and interpreter
- Experiment with my own custom syntax and language features

## Current Features
- Variable Declarations
- Parenthesis Grouping
- Custom Token System

## Future Features
- Functions
- Strings
- Return Statements
- Blocks '{ ... }'
- Conditionals
- Loops
